## Files:
- `MaartenStork_15761770_PaulJungnickâ€¦5716554_LucasKeijzer_14041073..ipynb` - Notebook containing plotting functions and results
- `mandelbrot.py` - Contains the Mandelbrot iteration algorithms
- `sampling_methods.py` - Contains methods for generating samples from the complex plane
- `GoogleColab.ipynb` - Contains the code from the Google Colab, this code can largly be ignored.
- `/plots` - Contains all the plots generated 

## Dependencies:
- **os**: Used for handling file paths and directory operations.
- **random**: For generating random numbers and seeds.
- **numpy** (`np`): Used for numerical operations, creating grids, and random number generation.
- **pandas** (`pd`): For data manipulation and analysis.
- **matplotlib** (`plt`): Used for plotting graphs and visualizations.
- **scipy.stats**: Used for statistical analysis, such as t-tests.
- **mpl_toolkits.mplot3d** (`Axes3D`): Used for creating 3D plots.

### Note
This assignment was collaboratively created in Google Colab, allowing us to work simultaneously on the same files. The full `.ipynb` file has been added to this repository alongside separate Python files for the functions used in the notebook. We used this collaborative approach to facilitate our work, but as a result, the division of code contributions as shown by Git-fame might not accurately reflect individual contributions since much of the work was done in Colab before transferring to this repository.
