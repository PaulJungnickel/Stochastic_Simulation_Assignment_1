## Files:
- `assignment1.ipynb` - Notebook containing plotting functions and results
- `mandelbrot.py` - Contains the Mandelbrot iteration algorithms
- `sampling_methods.py` - Contains methods for generating samples from the complex plane
- `FullResults_Assignment1.ipynb` - Contains the code from the Google Colab, this code can largly be ignored.
- `/plots` - Contains all the plots generated 


### Note
This assignment was collaboratively created in Google Colab, allowing us to work simultaneously on the same files. The full `.ipynb` file has been added to this repository alongside separate Python files for the functions used in the notebook. We used this collaborative approach to facilitate our work, but as a result, the division of code contributions as shown by Git-fame might not accurately reflect individual contributions since much of the work was done in Colab before transferring to this repository.
